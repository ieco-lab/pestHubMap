interactive applications to map properties that spread invasive species. contact mrhelmus@temple.edu

## Description

pestHubMap is a framework to build applications that map hubs at high risk of
transporting invasive pests among properties. The framework and code repo can be adapted to build applications for any invasive species. We developed pestHubMap in the context of the spotted lanternfly (SLF; *Lycorma
delicatula*). We provide a template framework and instructions to practice launching your apps.

See the examples that we have built for spotted lanternfly transport hubs in the USA states of [Pennsylvania](https://iecolab.org/slfDashboard/pestHubMap/pa_risk.html), [Illinois](https://iecolab.org/slfDashboard/pestHubMap/illinois_risk.html), and [many others](https://iecolab.org/slfDashboard/pestHubMap.html).

## Template and Instructions
To facilitate the use of the pestHubMap framework, we provide:
1. <ins>[Template](https://github.com/ieco-lab/pestHubMap/tree/main/instructions)</ins> code for the app which can serve as a framework for your pestHubMap. You can see a working version of the template app [here](https://www.iecolab.org/pestHubMap/template/).
2. <ins>[Instructions](https://github.com/ieco-lab/pestHubMap/tree/main/template)</ins> on how to obtain data and build and deploy the template locally and globally.

## FAQ
Most questions can be addressed by reading though our detailed [Instructions](https://github.com/ieco-lab/pestHubMap/tree/main/template). As more users start working with this repository, we will update this FAQ list. If you have a question, please add it as an issue or contact mrhelmus@temple.edu.   
-   *Why pestHubMap?*
    -   pest == any invasive species
    -   Hub == properties that accelerate invasive species spread
    -   Map == interactive mapping applications
-   *Why build pestHubMap Apps?*
    -   Invasive species spread rapidly via hubs. Our maps are designed to provide agencies with information to find and optimally allocate resources to control invasive species and control spread.
