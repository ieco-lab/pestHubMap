## Description

pestHubMap is a framework to build applications that map hubs at high risk of
transporting invasive pests among properties. The framework and code repo here can be adapted to build applications for any invasive species. We developed pestHubMap in the context of the spotted lanternfly (SLF; *Lycorma
delicatula*; see https://iecolab.org/slfDashboard/pestHubMap.html). In this gitHub we provide an template framework and instructions to practice launching your own app. The end product of the template will look as such: https://www.iecolab.org/pestHubMap/template/ 

-   *Why pestHubMap?*
    -   pest == any invasive species
    -   Hub == properties that accelerate invasive species spread
    -   Map == interactive mapping applications
-   *Why build pestHubMap Apps?*
    -   Invasive species spread rapidly via hubs. Our maps are designed to provide agencies with information to find and optimally allocate resources to control invasive species and control spread.

## Template and Instructions
To facilitate use of the pestHubMap framework, in this repo we provide:
1. <ins>Template</ins> code for the app which can serve as a framework for your own pestHubMap. https://www.iecolab.org/pestHubMap/template/
2. <ins>Instructions</ins> on how to obtain data and build and deploy the template locally and globally.
